# Face Recognition From Scratch with Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method that can be used for face recognition. However, PCA has its limitations, and current face recognition models normally use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to achieve higher accuracy.

This project aims to use PCA to build a working face recognition system from scratch, and compare its performance with state of the art CNNs.

## How it works
